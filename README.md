# projects

A home for all my side project ideas!

To make this repo more complete, it would be helpful to

- [ ] create a template for scoping and tracking projects
- [ ] do some sort of write-up for completed ideas
- [ ] make a brief list of skills learnt for each project

## Completed Ideas

- A blog made of containers ([`contained`](https://github.com/leoriviera/contained))

## In Progress Ideas

- Individually addressable LEDs that get their colours from the album art and are music reactive ([`rgbee`](https://github.com/leoriviera/rgbee))

## To Do Ideas

- A browser extension which locally recreates [GoLinks](https://www.golinks.io/)
- Using reinforcement learning to beat Chrome's [Dino Game](chrome://dino)
